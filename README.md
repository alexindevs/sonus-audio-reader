# Sonus Audio Reader

Sonus Audio Reader is a chrome browser extension that allows you to convert text content from web pages into audio format, enabling a convenient way to listen to articles, blog posts, and other forms of text content.
I came up with this one day as I was reading a blog post a friend of mine wrote. I wanted to support my friend, but the post was really long, and I had work to do. So I thought, "Hey, why not build something that could read out the text to you while you do other things?". That is how this extension was born.

## Features

- Capture and extract text content from web pages
